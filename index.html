			 <p><em>Where Am I Heading?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently embarking on a new venture, CoThinking, a marketing firm specialising in the B2B tech marketing sector.</p>
<p>My return to Innov8tif is a transitionary measure, with the management there providing substantial support to help with the company launch.</p>
<p><em>Why the Change?</em></p>
<p>Now, at 28, I&rsquo;ve spent a significant part of my adult life transitioning between jobs in search of a company to which I can fully commit. (Like Zhu Ge Liang waiting for a Liu Bei, as my high school friend once put it.)</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve come to realise that the greenest grass is the one I cultivate myself. Will it grow into a magnificent lawn? Or will it become overrun with weeds and die? Regardless, I have more control over my destiny than ever before.</p>
<p><em>What Lies Ahead?</em></p>
<p>Uncertainty, fear, and a considerable amount of anxiety. I foresee long hours, sleepless nights, heavy responsibilities, and inevitable sacrifices.</p>
<p>Yet, I&rsquo;ve met friends who open and shut businesses as if it&rsquo;s just an ordinary Tuesday. Building and running companies is normal to them, but this is a new and unfamiliar journey for me.</p>
<p>Being uneasy is natural. In the end, I&rsquo;m confident that everything will turn out fine. As long as I continue to learn and practice how to 做人, things will fall into place.</p>
<p><em>Reflecting on the Past</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Freelance work since I was 16.
I undertook various projects to support my hobbies, mainly camera gear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internship at Director&rsquo;s Think Tank.
The most trauma-inducing 90 days of my life, but it moulded me into the person I am today. I still wouldn&rsquo;t recommend joining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Videographer at ABC Studio.
Awesome environment, but the pay couldn&rsquo;t support me then. I often wonder how everyone there is doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brand Producer at Winner Dynasty.
Caught a glimpse of society&rsquo;s underbelly. Very fun, but also dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writer at Armani Media.
Growth via trial by fire. Met my first mentor whose influence still shaped my leadership style to this day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journalist at TheEdge.
Learnt about storytelling and learned how to behave around iMpoRtanT people. Met another awesome boss who taught me what it means to have my team&rsquo;s back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing Manager at Innov8tif
Finally experienced a respectable, livable wage. Doubled down on being a professional and got a taste of what it&rsquo;s like to be a boss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing Manager at ORLIG.
The true “executive” stage of my life, where I trade away talent &amp; knowledge for higher income.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Have been through a lot with a lifetime’s worth of trouble to come.
Let’s freaking go</p>

		<a href="https://jothamlim.com/2024/02/11/making-the-switch.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-11 08:00:00 &#43;0800">Feb 11, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I made the switch from Things (my main app for 3 years) to OF4 after learning about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUUaQF3_Pyo">David Sparks</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/142">CGP Grey&rsquo;s</a> approach to task management.</p>
<p>My issue with most to-do apps is that they are <strong>time-based</strong>, whether it&rsquo;s assigning a date or using time-blocking/calendar hybrids. This method is poor at <strong>task recovery</strong>.</p>
<p>My workdays are unpredictable and get disrupted all the time. Unfinished tasks today get rolled over to tomorrow, and tomorrow to the day after tomorrow, and so on. The only time-based app that does task recovery well is <strong>Skedpal</strong>, but it&rsquo;s expensive, ugly and requires a lot of configuring to use effectively.</p>
<h2 id="of4-helps-me-take-a-scrying-approach-to-task-management">OF4 Helps Me Take a “scrying” Approach to Task Management</h2>
<p>Tasks are like an infinite deck of cards, and it&rsquo;s impossible for us to finish them within our lifetime. The best we can do is to organise the pile and work through it card by card.</p>
<p>Time-based systems are arbitrary ways to cut this deck of cards. “I&rsquo;ll work on these top 10 today, and the next 9 tomorrow”. I find myself re-cutting the deck every time there&rsquo;s something unexpected in my schedule.</p>
<p>OF4 works by scrying — “Here are the top 3 cards you can work on at any given time. Oh, you can&rsquo;t work on them today? It&rsquo;s okay. These 3 cards will be waiting for you tomorrow, and I&rsquo;ll ping you if there&rsquo;s something more urgent that comes your way”. The combination of features like Review, first available, available, sequential projects, custom perspectives are hard to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only adopted this system over the past 2 weeks, and it works well with me so far. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario, I&rsquo;ll just go back to Things.</p>

			 <p><strong>I… have a complicated relationship with religion.</strong></p>
<p>For todays sermon, here are the main talking points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have to commit your entire being into building a temple of gods extremely high and unique requirements. Entire being involves mind, body, soul and wealth (which was mentioned thrice).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But commitment along is not enough — you have to be <strong>purified</strong> first: cleanse your mind of impure thoughts. There is no room for insecurity and doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service should involve the commitment of both husband and wife. Disharmony in the family is an impurity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LGBTQ communities are an affront to the sanctity of marriage, and we are tasked with guiding them to the right path.</p>

			 <p>This is my 7th blog migration now—away from WordPress, Obsidian Publish, <a href="https://Super.so">Super.so</a>, Ghost, Substack &amp; Hugo.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it&rsquo;s a form of procrastination. Spending more time messing around with websites means less time producing content.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s time wasted. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about web hosting and publishing with each content migration, and I believe that <a href="https://Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> is just one part of a long journey ahead.</p>
<h2 id="motive">Motive</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>I love sharing, but I dislike social media</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> is part of the <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> movement, where the key idea is to have content ownership in the hands of users.</li>
<li>By committing to social media platforms, I&rsquo;ll lock myself into walled gardens where content is difficult to migrate and control.</li>
<li>Moreover, it creates bad incentives—such as paying for exposure, preying on people&rsquo;s insecurities, and developing addictive time-sink features.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Pure blogging isn&rsquo;t right for me either.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The 6 blogging platforms mentioned above have one big challenge—<em>Reach</em>.</li>
<li>Despite hosting content on my own domain, I find myself still sharing them on platforms like LinkedIn &amp; Facebook to get some semblance of visitor traction.</li>
<li>Solutions like RSS feeds &amp; email subscriptions aim to help with that, but the &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; aspect of publishing can&rsquo;t be ignored.</li>
<li>Hence, I find myself maintaining several platforms instead of one, while facing the same aforementioned walled garden problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-i-came-across-microblog">How I came across Micro.Blog</h2>
<p>I first heard of webmentions while configuring the <a href="https://github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis">Anubis Theme</a> for Hugo.</p>
<p>I tend to remove unwanted features from my themes to make my site more efficient. But learning about webmentions led me down a deep rabbit hole of <a href="https://indieauth.com">IndieAuth</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a>, <a href="https://brid.gy">Brid.gy</a>, and a whole ecosystem of IndieWeb tools.</p>
<p>Getting my website &ldquo;Indiefied&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t difficult, and there are many resources out there that have helped. But I tried <em>hard</em> to make Micropub work on my site, but I can&rsquo;t seem to get it right.</p>
<p>My site passed many of the <a href="https://micropub.rocks">micropub.rocks</a> tests, but I can&rsquo;t connect it to iA writer for easy content publishing.</p>
<p>Not to mention, I dislike how fragile everything was. My site was held up by a ton of providers like GitHub, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, <a href="https://Webmentions.io">Webmentions.io</a>, <a href="https://Brid.gy">Brid.gy</a>, IndieAuth&hellip;</p>
<p>Knowing how each of these services works with each other is amazing, but they represent points of failure that need to be tackled in the future. I foresee myself spending hours troubleshooting issues rather than learning new things.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> was brought up early on during my research into the IndieWeb. I&rsquo;ve held off making a $5/month subscription because hosting my Hugo was free.</p>
<p>But a deck of cards is the only thing keeping my Hugo website afloat. The idea that Micro.Blog is also powered by Hugo, and it has all the IndieWeb configuration sorted (with a few minor tweaks), plus I don&rsquo;t need to worry about hosting issues—I think it&rsquo;s worth a shot.</p>

			 <p>Having my own website is essential to me.</p>
<p>Being an online lurker for so long, I have often regretted not contributing more to the internet space rather than just passive consumption . However, I disliked the idea of posting on social media and contributing towards data-hungry big tech corporations.</p>
<p>Hence, building a site on a custom domain is my way of carving out a small slice of the internet I can call my own.</p>
<p>I have tried many other platforms in the past (read below), but Hugo fits my current needs for now.</p>
<h2 id="hugo-my-current-cms-of-choice">Hugo: My Current CMS of Choice</h2>
<p>To be honest, I LOVE the platform! Here are a few reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hugo is blazingly fast.</strong> Hugo&rsquo;s rendering speed is measured in milliseconds. I&rsquo;ve seen full-blown websites being generated faster than a pro CS gamer clicking heads. SEO benefits aside, I just like how snappy the website is, which reminds me of the great UI/UX of many Mac apps.</li>
<li><strong>Makes me feel like a badass.</strong> I love the idea of tinkering around Git, HTML/YAML files &amp; using the terminal despite not being a programmer. Yet, Hugo is very accessible even to non-technical people if you follow the instructions carefully and understand what&rsquo;s going on.</li>
<li><strong>Obsidian is a core part of my daily life.</strong> Hugo uses markdown files, which I can load into my vault. With a git community plugin, I can publish content easily without leaving Obsidian!</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s free to set up.</strong> By hosting HUGO on Cloudflare Pages and using analytics tracking tools like Umami, I don&rsquo;t have to pay a single penny beyond purchasing a domain name. (Highly recommend <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>There&rsquo;s endless opportunities for tinkering.</strong> With thousands of free, open-source themes on Github, I can change the look and style of my site quickly without migrating the entire site.</li>
<li><strong>I like publishing pure text blog posts.</strong> Hugo has plenty of themes that are built for this. Many other platforms are designed in such a way that requires some level of commitment for images — even if it&rsquo;s a quick royalty-free one. I&rsquo;m a writer, not a designer.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are a few minor annoyances with the platform as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A mid-high learning curve.</strong> I can see why Hugo can be intimidating for many people. It still took me a while to understand how to set everything up. Sure, I can build a HUGO website in less than 2 minutes, but it takes a lot of troubleshooting to get it the way I want it.</li>
<li><strong>There&rsquo;s no default email-newsletter support.</strong> This feature comes by default on platforms like Ghost, Beehiiv or Substack. But it is entirely possible to create an RSS to email newsletter system. I heard good things about <a href="https://www.brevo.com">Brevo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hugo is the latest — but by no means the only website creation platform I&rsquo;ve used. Here are the other options that I&rsquo;ve tried in chronological order.</p>
<h2 id="notion--superso">Notion &amp; Super.so</h2>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>Mid-way through the pandemic, Notion had upturned how I created content, which at that point was primarily Google Docs. Beyond quickly organising and creating professional-looking documents, it allowed users to share documents publicly.</p>
<p>Naturally, I created my first personal website with it. This opened the doors to Notion → website translation services such as <a href="https://super.so">super.so</a>. Since then, Notion has introduced their own “Sites” feature.</p>
<p><strong>What I like</strong></p>
<p>Notion really knows how to strike a fine balance between customisation &amp; ease-of-use.</p>
<p>The way it handles images, text and page navigation… It opened up many doors that were previously tedious, cumbersome and impossible in traditional word processors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy for users to create a nice-looking website without any prior technical knowledge, which led me down the rabbit hole I&rsquo;m currently in.</p>
<p><strong>What I disliked</strong></p>
<p>The reason I stopped using Notion has less to do with it being a terrible CMS, and more to do with problems with Notion as a PKM in itself.</p>
<p>It requires an internet connection. It&rsquo;s powerful, but also bloated. Pages took a long time to load. I no longer enjoyed writing on Notion, and have since moved to other writing tools.</p>
<p>As a CMS, Notion&rsquo;s SEO and website loading speed is not great. It wasn&rsquo;t designed to be a website creation tool after all. But the real deal-breaker was the lack of custom domain support. It defeats the whole “carve out a corner of the internet” point of me starting a website.</p>
<h2 id="substack--ghost">Substack &amp; Ghost</h2>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;ve learned about the importance of audience ownership.</p>
<p>Being a novice marketer, my attention was primarily focused on website visits and social media engagements. A sizable chunk of marketing dollars are essentially spent “renting” traffic and eyeballs from Big Tech companies like Meta and Google.</p>
<p>This idea bothered me. I then turned my attention to newsletters — a form of audience engagement that&rsquo;s more loyal, intimate, and resilient to the ebb and flow of the social media trends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I got to know Substack and Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>What I like</strong>
Substack &amp; Ghost are built for and by writers; The website design, how posts are displayed, and the community sharing aspects are what made Substack a great place for journalists and casual bloggers.</p>
<p>Best of all, you can run a website on either platform for free or at a very low cost. It&rsquo;s also the first platform I came across that merges both the idea of blogging and newsletters.</p>
<p>Ghost is just Substack with more customisation options, self-hosting capabilities and fewer community functions. I&rsquo;ve tried it for a bit, found the theme system too cumbersome and expensive, and ultimately left Ghost after the trial period.</p>
<p><strong>What I dislike</strong>
There&rsquo;s nothing inherently bad about Substack as a platform for writers — I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the right platform for me.</p>
<p>Writing on Substack made me feel that my website&rsquo;s fate is heavily dependent on the platform. Sure, I could export a .csv file containing my email subscribers and migrate easily…but something about the platform made me uneasy.</p>
<p>I was conscious about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/12/casey-newton-quits-substack-nazi-newsletter">Nazi Controversy</a>, and was paying attention to how the website ranked in Google Trends within my country. I found myself comparing Substack and Medium a whole lot, and worrying about the platform more than actually creating content.</p>
<p>I dislike how most Substack websites look the same and are part of a singular ecosystem. Great for readers, but not for someone who wants their site to be unique.</p>
<p>I dislike how readers are bombarded with requests to subscribe from the get-go.</p>
<p>I dislike how I still need to add featured images to posts to make it “complete”.</p>
<p>I dislike how badly the domain performs on SEO.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s mostly a &lsquo;me problem&rsquo;. Substack is still what I&rsquo;d recommend for most people.</p>
<h2 id="wordpress">Wordpress</h2>
<p><strong>Story</strong>
Ah, ye old reliable. There&rsquo;s nothing to be said about WordPress , because its history and prominence speak for itself.</p>
<p>WordPress&rsquo; customisability, matured ecosystem and permanence is what drew me into the platform. After getting bored with Substack, I took a whole weekend to study plugins and hosting options to make my own website.</p>
<p><strong>What I like.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the go-to platform if you want your website to last for decades. Website development used to be hard, but is now easier thanks to drag and drop systems like Gutenberg and Elementor.</p>
<p>WordPress is extremely cheap to host and run. You can customise it however you want with the plugin marketplace.</p>
<p>But…that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p><strong>What I dislike</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that most website developers hate using WordPress because it&rsquo;s such a legacy system to work with.</p>
<p>The backend UI/UX is horrible. I dislike the idea of logging into my /wp-admin/ account to publish anything. There are ways around this, such as using APIs and tools like Ulysses, but it&rsquo;s finicky.</p>
<p>WordPress can load at the speed of light or crawl like a bug depending on your level of technical expertise. Fiddling around with Caches, CDNs and image optimisation is annoying.</p>
<p>WordPress reminds me of Notion. Many people hate it, but it&rsquo;s a system that works. There&rsquo;s only a few systems in the market like it, so we have no choice but to use it.</p>
<h2 id="obsidian-publish">Obsidian Publish</h2>
<p><strong>Story</strong>
I LOVE Obsidian. I&rsquo;ve been disloyal — flirting with Apple Notes, Mem, Bear, Capacities, AnyType.io, Noteplan and countless others — but I always return to Obsidian.</p>
<p>I used Obsidian Publish for a few days, but the subscription price at $8 per month and lack of comprehensive customisation options made me look elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>What I like</strong></p>
<p>The best thing about Obsidian Publish is that obsidian.md files translate perfectly onto the web. What you see on obsidian is exactly what you get on the web.</p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s integrated directly into Obsidian which means publishing is as simple as marking a note as &lsquo;For Publishing&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>What I dislike</strong></p>
<p>The price is quite steep for the service it provides, especially compared to actually hosting your own website.</p>
<p>The customisation options are very limited, from aesthetic choices (themes), to functionality with widgets and plugins. Other publishing systems are far more flexible and customizable.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I lead a small team of three. Though small, this department is an important one and has an undeniable impact on the company and the industry.</p>
<p>We are marketers on paper but also organisers, data analysts, salesmen, IT experts, culture builders, content creators and even automation engineers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a marketing background, hence the word “marketing” always had a bad rep in my mind—and for good reason. It&rsquo;s a word associated with deceit and manipulation.</p>
<p>But good initiatives need marketing efforts too. Closing The Gap, Axiata&rsquo;s Young CEO Development programme … I came across these awesome initiatives precisely because of their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Now, I realise that marketing exists outside the realm of morality. It is merely the craft of presenting and positioning, a craft with an endless skill ceiling.</p>
<p>How people outside the company view us, and how the company views itself heavily depends on the work we do. Being in this position for 18 months, maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad after all.</p>
<hr>
<p>I thought only people in their early/mid-thirties get to be heads of departments. To be in this position at this age is something I&rsquo;m grateful for. I had assumed that my “leadership” glory days were behind me a decade ago—holding top positions within youth organisations and clubs.</p>
<p>But I also remember the extreme stress that comes along with the role. President, chairman, department head … everyone likes the title but not the work accompanying it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t fun getting unwilling participants to have a discussion, let alone committing to a programme. It&rsquo;s not fun balancing the high expectations from above and the lack of enthusiasm below. It&rsquo;s not fun working without resources, relying only on creative minds and the goodwill of people to get things done.</p>
<p>Being in charge of a club is prestigious, but it also feels like having dirty laundry dumped on you. “But you&rsquo;re so good at cleaning! You&rsquo;re better at it than I am. Thanks a lot, man!”</p>
<p>Hence, the past decade of being a solo worker has been liberating. I was a writer, journalist, and a solo freelancer—videographer, editor and producer all in one.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t have to seek permission to start or change anything.</li>
<li>I can move fast and efficiently without shackles holding me down.</li>
<li>I am accountable to only my client, employers and only myself.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m the one being mentored rather than doing the mentoring.</li>
</ul>
<p>But things have changed. I&rsquo;ve had bosses who took good care of me. They fought for my salary, taught me everything I knew, and shouldered blame even though it was clearly my fault.</p>
<p>Some even spent a fortune out of their pockets to have drinks together, asking nothing in return. They only hoped that I would show kindness to my future subordinates, just like they did to me.</p>
<p>With this decree in hand, I&rsquo;m again back in a leadership position after a half-decade dry spell. I&rsquo;m met with very familiar challenges but unique ones as well. I&rsquo;ve boiled down my key learnings to these few points.</p>
<h2 id="10the-pride-of-building-a-fearless-department">1.0—The Pride of Building a Fearless Department</h2>
<p>When I first joined the company, I had no idea how to build a team culture.</p>
<p>I just threw random words on a Miro board and forced my team to adhere to it. “A culture of documentation, continuous learning and being tech-orientated”—something along those lines. I didn&rsquo;t revisit this culture statement for an entire year.</p>
<p>Instead, I mainly focused on avoiding bad practices rather than building good ones—no more unproductive meetings, asking stupid questions, and a dreadful lack of purpose in day-to-day work. I created initiatives with these pain points in mind instead.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I read <em>The Apple Experience by Carmine Gallo</em> that I realised what I was trying to build all along.</p>
<p>I wanted to assemble, train and build <strong>fearless employees</strong>.</p>
<p>Fearless employees focus on fulfilling key objectives and are not concerned about the “problems surrounding the problems”. They don&rsquo;t have to seek permission for everything, worry about the tools they use, or do guesswork on my expectations and opinions of them. The results and their personal growth are the only goals.</p>
<p>Fearless employees have self-confidence built on top of solid competence where it matters. Fearlessness is unlike arrogance which hides insecurities. It involves the courage to admit shortcomings and seek help when needed. It&rsquo;s admitting that “I&rsquo;ve never done this before, and I don&rsquo;t know how it will turn out, but I&rsquo;ll try.”</p>
<p>Fearless employees enjoy their work more often because they take pride in it. They don&rsquo;t look over their shoulders, alt-tabbing out of YouTube or Whatsapp messages whenever I walk past. My team does it to my face, and I&rsquo;m okay with it. They should only be concerned about disappointing themselves and the team which believes in them.</p>
<p>Fearless employees take ownership of their work—and their language reflects that. When taking on assignments, it&rsquo;s never a cold “okay” or a dismissive “Can&rsquo;t we…?”. My team uses cringe phrases like “aye aye, captain” or “sure thing, bossman”.</p>
<p>Building a fearless department is surprisingly simple, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires <strong>establishing clear expectations</strong>. This means giving the team explicit authority to make specific calls, where they are allowed to make mistakes, and where there can&rsquo;t be compromises.</li>
<li>It requires <strong>having their backs</strong>. If other people have problems with my department&rsquo;s performance or how they work, all complaints should go to me. Fault and responsibility lie on the department head, even if it&rsquo;s the individual&rsquo;s fault.</li>
<li>It requires <strong>demonstration</strong>. Fear is the default state, and fearlessness needs to be trained. New recruits need to see the seniors correcting my mistakes and making fun of my insecurities without getting punished. The team needs to see me go toe-to-toe with upper management and defend what I believe is right.</li>
<li>Most importantly, it requires <strong>caring about who they are and what they believe in</strong>. Fearlessness is layered on top of trust, which can only be built through deep empathy and spending consistent, quality time together.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, managers can merely facilitate the cultivation of a fearless department. It is ultimately a process we have little control over—because it heavily depends on the personalities, convictions and capabilities of those in it. My department has had other staff members that did not jive with the philosophy and eventually left.</p>
<p>Hence, I&rsquo;d rolled a W on the celestial dice when landing on my current team. I am extremely lucky to have them.</p>
<p>They are dependable and capable when necessary but also goofballs when times are lighter. They are also … real and humane, which is a strange way to put it, but it is severely lacking in many places I&rsquo;ve come across. Working in soulless corporations can be surreal and inhumane sometimes.</p>
<h2 id="20proper-departmental-bureaucracy-yields-compounding-returns">2.0—Proper Departmental Bureaucracy Yields Compounding Returns</h2>
<p>To reward myself for joining this new company, I retired my stinky old laptop for a shiny new Macbook. From there, I went down a deep productivity rabbit hole which I haven&rsquo;t climbed out of till this day.</p>
<p>Task management, folder organisation, calendars—each has its own unique framework and methodology. The names may differ, but the core underlying principle remains the same. More importantly, it is scalable to a team setting with just a few minor tweaks.</p>
<p>My research spilt over to project management, change management and team communication. I&rsquo;ve learnt how to plan and pitch, which led to new software tools in the pipeline. The systems the department use daily are the outcome of my experimentations from my personal productivity system and trial and error from how the team reacted to the new tools.</p>
<p>Many systems were set up, but I just want to focus on these two:</p>
<h3 id="21systems-of-information">2.1—Systems Of Information</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with informational systems because it&rsquo;s fundamental to many interpersonal issues within the workplace.</p>
<p>I noticed that a lot of unnecessary anger and frustration comes from information retrieval:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Hey, can you send me this PDF by today?”</li>
<li>“Who is our partner for this project again?”</li>
<li>“How many leads have we captured within this month?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Even worse is the way these questions are asked. Most are via instant messaging rather than email, implying urgency and interrupting people when they are “in the zone”.</p>
<p>The most egregious is when the question is asked in a <strong>group chat</strong> and not directed to a specific person. Should you answer it? Should I answer it? It looks urgent. We shouldn&rsquo;t ignore it. Now there&rsquo;s a cat-and-mouse game where someone has to volunteer to do the work. It&rsquo;s either that or you have six executives scrambling to retrieve a document that can be easily found with a quick search on Google Drive.</p>
<p>These “non-problems” drive me insane, but what shocks me is how many people are willing to just go along with it. It seems part and parcel of the workplace culture. If I want to dislike someone, I want to do so because they&rsquo;re an asshole, not because they&rsquo;re inept at sourcing information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve spent significant effort establishing a single-source-of-truth (SSOT) using Notion. Every marketing material and every status on projects, campaigns and exhibition events is stored in a single place that everyone can easily access. If it&rsquo;s not on Notion, it doesn&rsquo;t exist. No duplicated information is stored on multiple cloud platforms or, god-forbid, someone&rsquo;s local drive.</p>
<p>The best part? It has nothing to do with the software or technology itself. I can easily establish an SSOT on Google Drive, Miro, or even Google Keep if I&rsquo;m desperate. It mainly boils down to establishing clear processes, explaining how it works and why it&rsquo;s important to the team, and guiding them for the first two weeks.</p>
<p>With that, my (current) team has never asked me any “stupid” questions like…ever. I can&rsquo;t recall the last time I received a non-important inquiry within the department. Whenever my team speaks to each other, it&rsquo;s either we&rsquo;re screwing around, having high-level strategic discussions, or it&rsquo;s personal development in nature.</p>
<p>This leads to the following:</p>
<h3 id="22systems-of-communication">2.2—Systems Of Communication</h3>
<p>My company adopts a hybrid work culture, and it&rsquo;s a tricky arrangement to work with as a manager.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you want to maximise face-to-face time amongst team members for productivity&rsquo;s sake and to establish a sense of “belonging” to the team. Good luck trying to build a culture through texts on a screen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, working from home and having personal space is essential to many people and a key reason why many joined the company in the first place. To force employees to come to the office is a dealbreaker for many.</p>
<p>To address this, I&rsquo;ve implemented the most important departmental policy I&rsquo;ve ever introduced—daily standups. There are many variations and loose implementations via SCRUM methodologies, but mine is absurdly strict.</p>
<p>Everyone shows up at 9.15am and explains what they have done, what they plan on doing today, and any obstacles they face in completing their tasks. The session should last 15 minutes at most, and any deeper discussions warrant a separate meeting. The event starts on time, with or without anyone present. There are a few exceptions, mainly involving the team attending exhibitions and such.</p>
<p>The daily standup is crucial in my department because it serves as our <strong>sole accountability system</strong>. With daily standup, I can implement a results-only-working-environment (ROWE). You can come to the office late, renew your passport in the morning, or send your car to the workshop in the afternoon—as long as you have something to show for in the daily standup the next day.</p>
<p>It also serves as a <strong>productivity mechanism</strong>, making our daily tasks visible to everyone. I don&rsquo;t have to scold or scream at any of my teammates for being lazy. We all realise how unproductive we are when the same task persists for multiple days and will automatically take active steps to fix them.</p>
<p>More importantly, teammates shouldn&rsquo;t be scolded for being unproductive, either. If the team is unproductive, it&rsquo;s largely a work-related obstacle that needs resolving, a sign of deteriorating mental health, or private issues—all of which need to be supported rather than punished.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that teams tend to perform better when they&rsquo;re allowed to get their affairs in order, and sometimes that means taking a day or two to reset. Without such a mechanism, stagnant tasks may persist for weeks and months until it blows up in your face when you least expect it.</p>
<p>Finally, it serves as the team&rsquo;s <strong>baseline commitment towards each other</strong>. Sometimes the team never see each other physically for a month due to holidays or overseas exhibitions. Showing up every workday to a 15-minute virtual call <em>on time</em> is the simplest task we can do for the team and is a sign of respect. It&rsquo;s like falling in during a marshall drill. You don&rsquo;t do it for the commander or yourself but for the team.</p>
<p>Anything beyond daily standups is just the cherry on top. For instance, I&rsquo;ve implemented <strong>degrees of escalation</strong> to help facilitate the urgency in communication and asynchronous working.</p>
<p>Any matters that are time-sensitive warrant a Whatsapp or a G.Chat message. Non-urgent tasks, such as reviewing documents, only requires an email or a mention on Notion. Anything important but not-urgent warrants a quick meeting, which can be quickly scheduled via Google Calendar without a back-and-forth permission request.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also enforced the practice of having <strong>meeting agendas and meeting minutes</strong>. I have witnessed far too many 3-hour discussion roundabouts that ended nowhere, and I will have none of that in my department. Agendas and minutes make meetings purposeful, effective and efficient.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the <strong>bi-weekly retrospective session</strong>, where we have WIFLE (What I Feel Like Expressing), something I&rsquo;ve learnt from a BFM interview with business coach Jeevan Sahadevan. Everyone takes turns sharing anything without judgement, and it&rsquo;s a great way to measure burnout levels. This is also where we have sharing sessions, workshops or project post-mortems.</p>
<h3 id="23side-tangent">2.3—Side Tangent</h3>
<p>I abhor the improper use of the collective “we” and the vague “should” in group meetings, which I find <em>everywhere</em>. “I think we should…” “Let&rsquo;s find a way…” “Maybe we can….”</p>
<p>While great for brainstorming, it&rsquo;s almost always used when someone gives a neutral statement or highlights an obstacle—not an appropriate moment to provide suggestions. Many people get excited about <strong>publicly</strong> sharing opinions on how to improve or how problems should be solved. When it comes to actually taking ownership of the project, eyes will start darting around the room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not company-specific, either. It persists everywhere, from high school event planning and college assignment groups to boardroom meetings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It gives the illusion of contribution.</strong> Many people feel smug after offering suggestions. They don&rsquo;t realise that opinions are just doors to possible solutions, not a replacement for strategy and work distribution.</li>
<li><strong>It is lazy.</strong> It is easy to offer opinions without context on the subject matter. Problem-solvers know that available options get increasingly narrower the more they understand the scope of the problem. Offering unfounded opinions just makes you look dumb at best and invalidates the actual hard work problem-solvers have committed to at worse.</li>
<li><strong>It is manipulative.</strong> It is a risk-free, win-win scenario for the person offering their opinions. If their opinion doesn&rsquo;t work out, it is “our” problem or the execution sucks. But if it does work out, their ideas are validated, and they can take the credit. In their minds, offering suggestions is always a good look.</li>
</ul>
<p>The worst part? Offering unsolicited suggestions mid-way stalls an entire discussion, forcing conversations into a tangent that will most likely go nowhere. The conclusion is either “we will revisit this next time”, or topics move on entirely without a conclusion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, solving this only requires a proper meeting agenda where there&rsquo;s time and space to solicit these suggestions. The meeting must end with an action plan, which is dead simple: Who does what by when? Have it written down, and have it reviewed by the next meeting. It&rsquo;s just that easy. Rant over.</p>
<h2 id="30accepting-issues-outside-my-control">3.0—Accepting Issues Outside My Control</h2>
<p>A decade of freelancing has changed my work philosophy.</p>
<p>The challenge of being a jack of all trades is that I don&rsquo;t have fixed services to bring to the table. Each unique situation calls for a different skillset, be it filmmaking, writing or PR consulting. Charging for these services is even worse because companies rarely want to pay for consulting services by the hour. So what am I ultimately getting paid for?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve settled on project-based payments, with the philosophy that <strong>people pay me to care about their company as if it&rsquo;s my own</strong>.</p>
<p>This works well for me. Without this philosophy, I can&rsquo;t bring myself to commit my heart &amp; effort to a project without caring about the current &amp; future state of the company. It also enables me to turn down clients I dislike or projects I can&rsquo;t get behind, like MLM companies or shady gurus. (<em>There&rsquo;s a huge demand for ghostwriters for their autobiographies and non-fiction books.</em>)</p>
<p>Working this way means consulting is baked into the project costs. The scope is highly process-&amp;-outcome-orientated rather than materials-orientated. I assess the situation, make plans to fix them, and get the green light from stakeholders. Clients didn&rsquo;t need to micromanage my work because they knew I had their best interests at heart.</p>
<p>While this philosophy has worked well for me as a solo worker, moving into a permanent managerial position has changed my perspective. In this context, I don&rsquo;t think going above and beyond is a display of enthusiasm and active participation. In some scenarios, it means stepping over grey boundaries that were not clearly laid out.</p>
<p>Being a manager opened my eyes to the theoretical side of <strong>politics in the workplace</strong> —and not in a bad way. More specifically, it&rsquo;s the interesting interplay between management and politics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Politics WILL exist when multiple parties need to make a collective decision—be it discussing where to have dinner with your spouse or a team discussion on the date of an exhibition event. There is never an “absence” of politics. Like rules, it is always there. Companies can only decide if they want to make it transparent and manageable. With uncontrolled politics, the boundaries are never clear, nobody wants to make a decision, and initiatives are left to fate.</li>
<li>Proper management NEEDS politics to function because politics is the ever-changing ebb and flow of power—power that is needed to push initiatives forward. That&rsquo;s because projects and solutions need an endorsement to turn from a plan into a reality. A variation of “I&rsquo;ll support your initiative if you support mine” always exists implicitly or explicitly. Such is a fundamental pillar of management.</li>
<li>Conversely, politics NEED proper management to be facilitated. Bureaucracy may sound horrible, but the lack of it is even worse. That&rsquo;s because bureaucracy is the vaults that control the ebb and flow of power. Meeting minutes and agendas are an example of that. Bureaucracy also separates the people problem from the systems problem. With bureaucracy, getting items approved is no longer about currying favours from individuals, but a side quest involving obtaining the necessary signatures from well-defined parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly, during my early months, I have been focusing too much on management that I neglected the importance of gathering political power. This sound like Little Finger from Game of Thrones, but hear me out.</p>
<p>How does one “gain” political power? The keyword: <strong>capital</strong>…or leverage. They mean the same thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have <strong>financial capital</strong>. People have no choice but to listen to you because you outright own a part of the company.</li>
<li>You could also have <strong>knowledge capital</strong>, gaining authority because you know things that others do not—be it internal affairs, partner relations and so on.</li>
<li>Your powerbase can come from <strong>social capital</strong>, where you&rsquo;ve spent years building friendships and garnering favours with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;ve primarily relied on <strong>career capital</strong>: the ability to get things done. Although most people want meritocracy, being capable alone does not give someone the necessary strength to make an impact. That&rsquo;s why useless politicians still get elected, and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p>Understanding this concept fundamentally helps me accept that <strong>certain things are outside my control,</strong> because I don&rsquo;t have the necessary capital to do so. In certain cases, garnering more capital requires me to make sacrifices I&rsquo;m unwilling to make, and I&rsquo;m okay with that. “If you don&rsquo;t like something, do something about it!” Well, that line is drawn here, and admitting that line exists is a critical step in stoicism.</p>
<p>It is pragmatic, but by no means it&rsquo;s pessimistic. There&rsquo;s plenty of room on this side of the line! I&rsquo;ve also learnt that <strong>capital can be shared</strong>.</p>
<p>I can share social capital by endorsing my teammates for a promotion and salary raise that they clearly deserve. I can share knowledge capital via water-cooler conversations or over a few drinks with colleagues. I can distribute my career capital by coaching my team and having private team workshop sessions.</p>
<p>Sharing capital with others provides a strange sense of fulfilment, and it&rsquo;s never a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>Capital is only effective when it is spent. I&rsquo;ve exhausted a lot of goodwill with upper management acquiring new tools and implementing policies that look controversial to others. It&rsquo;s a price that needs to be paid to help my team work happier and more meaningfully.</p>
<p>So do think about it. If you have a limited amount of capital, how would you spend it or share it? Personally, I never recommend hoarding it, but this seems to be the status quo in large MNCs and tiny startups alike. “Why should I go above and beyond and risk anything?”</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s called not putting your skin into the game; Skin needed to implement changes that you know are important. Making lives better—be it your own, your colleagues or the overall well-being of the company—requires initiatives that need to be spent and leveraged through said capital.</p>
<p>To not use them is choosing to live under undesirable circumstances rather than doing undesirable work to fix them. One requires payment out of one&rsquo;s own pocket—risking effort, goodwill and reputation. The other only requires collective tolerance, a tax collected from others.</p>
<hr>
<p>This pretty much summarises my key learnings as a manager. If I am capable, perhaps I should reflect on my time as a journalist and write a similar piece as well.</p>
<p>This reminds me: For every client, story interviewee and boss that I&rsquo;ve ever interacted with, I&rsquo;ve always asked two questions. “What is the core essential skill that every employee should have?” half the time, they say <strong>continuous learning</strong>. (Critical thinking and creativity are top contenders) This essay is my attempt at capturing my personal growth over the snapshot of 18 months.</p>
<p>The other question is, “What kind of company/department are you trying to build here?” Almost every time, they give me a vague or half-arsed answer. But it is also understandable. Answering this requires deep introspection and emotional processing, elements that are hard to find in this highly distracting, hustle-filled world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just grateful that I have managed to find my own answer to this question this early in life.</p>
<p>Stay fearless, my team and future me.</p>

			 <p>I had a discussion with a friend about rising property prices. Both of us are in our late 20s.</p>
<p>“We have it tough. During our parent&rsquo;s time, homes could be bought with cash. The economy was booming back then, and that&rsquo;s how affordable houses were.”</p>
<p>Someone older heard us and came over. “Yeah, but have you seen current interest rates? You young people have it easier. Housing loans are so cheap now, and easier to obtain.”</p>
<p>I was stunned—enraged, even. As if lifelong debt to the bank is preferable to saving up to outright own your own home! But my anger soon mellowed into confusion, then settled into disappointment.</p>
<p>After all, he&rsquo;s not alone in his perspective. The things we take for granted, like private vehicles, air conditioning and computer devices, were considered luxuries back then. My parents had none of these, and no doubt, our lives are better thanks to their hardships.</p>
<p>But does that mean we have it easier?</p>
<p>In the end, this isn&rsquo;t a conversation about which generation has it worse; it&rsquo;s a moot topic with the only outcome being a race to the bottom. Each of us has our own plight regardless of race, religion, age, or gender.</p>
<p>The truth is, there is never really a bygone era that is “better” or “worse”—only unique circumstances we are facing today. The better question to ask is, how do we operate under these conditions? When looked from this perspective, perhaps this era is ripe full of opportunities for us young adults.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We live in an age of access</strong>. I have plenty of friends freelancing for overseas companies from the comfort of their gaming chairs, benefitting from the exchange rate. I can access lectures from Ivy League on YouTube for free. I can get in touch with my local MP with a Tweet or WhatsApp message. We no longer have to wait hours in line to complete a simple bureaucratic task. The world fits in the palm of our hands, and we are just as accessible to it.</li>
<li><strong>We live in a web of ideas.</strong> In the past, our belief systems were formed through our education, community, and surroundings. But on the internet, we are exposed to all forms of media from all corners of the earth. Every stupid statement or nugget of genius is constantly contested, defended, and scrutinised. Exposing ourselves to these ideas and seriously contemplating them builds character, empathy, and tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>We live in an era of productivity.</strong> Not everyone has financial access to a highly qualified personal assistant. But today, I have A.I. and automation software that automatically schedules my calendar, transcribes and summarises meeting notes, writes my emails, and organises my files. It is entirely possible to run an entire company as a solo entrepreneur using the right tools.</li>
<li><strong>We live in a time where change is attainable.</strong> It&rsquo;s now easier to mobilise movements and create impact as an individual. <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/06/17/sabah-girl-stays-in-tree-to-get-internet-connection">A village girl can highlight issues with internet connectivity in rural areas</a>, compelling the government to speed up digitalisation efforts. <a href="https://undi18.org/">Students from the UNDI18 movement have successfully lobbied Parliament to amend the federal constitution</a>. We&rsquo;ve changed our government several times now, something that was unfathomable many years ago. I can easily publish this article to thousands of readers with just a few clicks—try doing that using pen and paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t deny that we&rsquo;re moving towards adversity, but we&rsquo;re also equipped with the resources to better our situation.</p>
<p>We can choose to upskill ourselves and demand a self-respecting wage from our employers equivalent to the value we deliver. We can choose to point out and respond to everyday injustice with a “ 👁️ 👄 👁️”. We can choose to break down the racial, religious, and language barrier with a smile and a nod. A simple kindness can go a long way in humanising people across a divide.</p>
<p>Because what is change without action and willpower? Would we rather live in undesirable circumstances than do the undesirable work? We all play a role in deciding who we are and who we want to be. We all can decide what this country is and isn&rsquo;t—so don&rsquo;t let other people be that voice for you.</p>

			 <p>I am obsessed with productivity systems. From Ali Abdaal to James Clear, Keep Productive to Cal Newport… task apps, calendars, daily planners, and personal knowledge management—if it exists in the Apple ecosystem, chances are I&rsquo;ve tried it before.</p>
<p>Have I become more productive after this exercise? Yes! I can&rsquo;t imagine going back to the life of drifting aimlessly, living life by default and not by design. However, I went past the point of diminishing returns a long time ago.</p>
<p>Fiddling around with productivity tools has become its own form of procrastination. It&rsquo;s a more dangerous sort because it tricks you into believing that you are much more productive than you actually are.</p>
<p>There are plenty of courses teaching you how to implement GTD, Zettelkasten, and PARA methods. Many are free; others are unjustifiably expensive. I found myself unable to stick to a fixed system, but it pays to understand the underlying core principles.</p>
<p>Even now, I encourage my peers and juniors to dive into the world of productivity systems and tools. But to avoid the same pitfalls, here&rsquo;s a summary of what I&rsquo;ve learned thus far:</p>
<h2 id="picking-out-an-ecosystem"><strong>Picking Out an Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s OK to keep up to date with the latest trends in the productivity space. However, it&rsquo;s essential to be mindful of the migration cost of constantly switching between different ecosystems.</p>
<p>Every day, I receive a new email highlighting new A.I. capabilities or a feature that makes the app perfect for specific use cases, but it&rsquo;s generally not worth the jump.</p>
<p>I fell down the productivity rabbit hole because I want to enjoy my day job, but there is a clear distinction between enjoying using an app and doing the actual work. Most new features are unlikely to make you productive, even with “GPT” in the headline.</p>
<p>Here are things to consider if you&rsquo;re looking to commit to an ecosystem:</p>
<h3 id="1-create-a-list-of-requirements-and-priorities"><strong>1. Create a List of Requirements and priorities</strong></h3>
<p>This is the most challenging step, and I recommend taking time to think this through. Even the most obscure app has a dedicated fanbase because it does one niche thing and does it well.</p>
<p>Every app has strengths and weaknesses, and ranking your requirements is critical to stopping yourself from succumbing to the shiny object syndrome. The parameters to consider include cost, supported platforms, UI/UX, quick capture capabilities, dedicated features, collaboration, and file storage.</p>
<h3 id="2-decide-if-you-want-an-integrated-system-or-a-best-of-breed"><strong>2. Decide if You Want an Integrated System or a best-of-breed</strong></h3>
<p>A single app that does everything, from task management to notes,  is unlikely to be powerful or customisable (Noteplan 3, TickTick). On the other hand, using highly specialised dedicated apps can be expensive and complicated to keep track of (Things 3, Cron, Obsidian).</p>
<p>Deciding this early on will help you narrow down your options a lot. In most cases, you will adopt a hybrid approach—but deciding how to segment it is a decision by itself. Most people I found online prefer bundling tasks and calendars into a daily planner while having a separate PKMS / note-taking system.</p>
<h3 id="3-abuse-the-free-trials"><strong>3. Abuse the Free trials</strong></h3>
<p>Productivity tools can be expensive, but most have a comfortable trial period to test them out, ranging from 7 days to a whole month. Some tips include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancelling your subscription immediately after signing up to prevent unexpected charges</li>
<li>Having multiple email accounts to extend the testing period,</li>
<li>Taking advantage of rewards (limited-time discounts, referral bonuses, cancellation discounts).</li>
</ul>
<p>Only pay for apps that you are sure you will stick to for months at least.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-matters-more-than-technology"><strong>Workflow Matters More Than Technology</strong></h2>
<p>Not only is it free to learn a workflow from YouTube videos and Reddit threads, but systems and processes significantly impact productivity more than the technology itself.</p>
<p>Productivity apps exist to facilitate processes, not dictate them on your behalf. Many apps are designed to suit a specific workflow (Omnifocus with GTD), and you can&rsquo;t use the app to its fullest extent without understanding the principles it is built upon in the first place.</p>
<p>Adopting a new app sometimes only involve a slight tweak to your workflow, but others demand an entire overhaul, and it took me some time to learn where to draw the line—especially when I haven&rsquo;t figured out a default workflow yet.</p>
<p>Most apps come with help documentation, and it is worth taking 30 minutes to review the app&rsquo;s core features quickly. Some apps do not have a straightforward user onboarding journey (<em>cough</em> Obsidian), which makes them very non-beginner-friendly. However, most apps I&rsquo;ve encountered have YouTube tutorials and reviews highlighting how to use the app as intended.</p>
<p>When creating a personalised workflow, my advice is to keep it simple and stupid. For instance, systems like Zettelkasten are effective but require constant maintenance to upkeep. They&rsquo;re great for academics or journalists but are called digital gardens for a reason. It is only beneficial when you have thousands of notes and spend most of your day managing textual data.</p>
<p>But for most people, it takes effort to upkeep the system daily. Capturing and using atomic notes is more troublesome than Googling or understanding the subject matter outright.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m using a dumbed-down version of GTD for task management and time-blocking. I also have a single folder to dump all my notes, navigating them solely using tags and smart searches. It&rsquo;s fast and gets the job done.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-fun-and-readiness-in-productivity"><strong>The Role of Fun and Readiness in Productivity</strong></h2>
<p>A big hurdle for me when choosing productivity apps or workflows was deciding between user experience and everything else, such as cost, A.I. capabilities, data privacy, etc.</p>
<p>Affordable apps with great UX tend to lack features. An app that does everything like Sunsama and Akiflow is expensive.</p>
<p>Obsidian is an excellent example of this—it&rsquo;s fast, quick, highly customisable and a beast of a PKMS tool. But I hardly used backlinks, and I spent more time tinkering with the system than actually processing and producing content. Scrolling through my list of installed community plugins gives me anxiety. I disliked having to wait for notes to sync every time I switched devices and how it&rsquo;s not designed for the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>On the other hand, apps like Things 3 are dead simple to use. The UX/UI is wonderful, and you can tell that the developers have spent years finicking over the tiniest of details. But it lacks basic functionality compared to many other apps, like natural language input, streamlined time-blocking abilities and more.</p>
<p>From personal experience, especially for someone new in the productivity space, it&rsquo;s worth prioritising the “fun” -ness of the app over its features.</p>
<p>Adopting a powerful tool and workflow for future-proofing is tempting. You may want to find the “best” ever app or workflow and stick to it. But very rarely is there the “best” app—the only one that is right for you now. Switching methodologies as time passes is common, but the problem lies in how we change.</p>
<p>Hence, for new practitioners, having a fun system to dedicate towards is more important. It&rsquo;s not worth setting up a more convoluted system for a 2% increase in productivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that these advanced systems suck or are over-engineered. It&rsquo;s that we are not ready to take advantage of these advanced systems just yet—which leads to the following:</p>
<h2 id="output-is-the-only-thing-that-matters"><strong>Output Is the Only Thing That Matters</strong></h2>
<p>I was inspired to write this article because of a recent note migration exercise involving 550~ notes collected throughout a year, which, granted, is a small amount within the PKMS space.</p>
<p>Because of formatting issues, I had to import them manually one by one—which allowed me to review my notes and purge many irrelevant ones.</p>
<p>I ended up with only 75 notes afterwards—most of it is my published content and essential details on my friends and family. Most of my Zettelkasten notes and Readwise highlights didn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>This made me reflect on my approach towards note-taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is building a second brain overrated?</li>
<li>Why bother with digital productivity when the great minds in the past could do well with pen and paper?</li>
<li>How important is note organisation in relation to note creation?</li>
<li>Why am I outsourcing my remembering process instead of adequately understanding, contemplating, and digesting the content I&rsquo;ve read?</li>
</ul>
<p>After sitting on these questions, I concluded that digital productivity and PKMS tools are still very much relevant. The fact that I am delivering results at work more consistently than before and still have 75 important notes in the first place is attributed to the systems I have built, and is worth celebrating.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a stark reminder that our productivity systems only exist to help us do important work better and faster. The system is rarely the bottleneck—we are.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m trying to stick to the “whatever works” principle. I&rsquo;m using Apple native tools for now—Notes, Reminders and Calendarall of which compelled me to switch to the Apple ecosystem 18 months ago.</p>
<p>Of course, I will still try out new tools for fun. I&rsquo;ll probably write a few reviews on them down the road—as long as I recognise it for what it truly is, a hobby and curious pursuit instead of an attempt to be more productive.</p>

			 <p>Of all the habits I&rsquo;ve built up in recent years, consistent reading is the one that has helped me the most. It formed the foundation of my personal productivity system, forced me to reflect on my existing bad habits, and even shaped my belief system.</p>
<p>However, it wasn&rsquo;t the easiest habit to build up. Books can be long-winded and slow to go through if you read line by line. YouTube videos and Reddit posts are more engaging, shorter and dense with information.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d argue that reading is the best medium to convey ideas and abstract concepts, because it forces us to <strong>actively</strong> consume content.</p>
<p>It unveils imaginative sceneries buried within the deep recesses of the mind. Sometimes you stop and digest your newfound paradigm shifts. There&rsquo;s no need for a pause button, or a playback speed slider. For non-fiction, boring and irrelevant parts are easily skippable, unlike annoying ads.</p>
<p>To share my appreciation towards the medium, here are a few books that I highly recommend:</p>
<h2 id="flowers-for-algernon-by-daniel-keyes">Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes</h2>
<p>This is a science fiction story of Charlie Gordon, a mentally challenged man with an IQ of 68. He was often taken advantage of, but his kind naivety and iron determination to improve himself earned him many allies along the way, as well as the heart of his teacher, Alice Kinnian.</p>
<p>(Un)fortunately, he was selected to undergo surgery to increase his intelligence. He became more aware of the world and people around him, slowly appreciating the complexities of life. He made a series of scientific breakthroughs which resulted in immense wealth and fame, but it also changed him as a person for the worse.</p>
<p>His newfound intelligence did not last long, either. He gradually regressed back into the life of a mentally disabled man. Fear, obsession and pride ensued, as well as losing the love of his life.</p>
<p>This story raises many ethical questions about the nature of intelligence, the themes of loneliness, isolation and the human desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that this book is part of the regular curriculum in many schools and universities. I only learned about it through a Reddit post. So if you haven&rsquo;t picked up the book yet, it is seriously an enjoyable read.</p>
<h2 id="triggers-by-marshall-goldsmith--atomic-habits-by-james-clear">Triggers by Marshall Goldsmith &amp; Atomic Habits by James Clear</h2>
<p>I used to be a self-help/productivity junkie. Many of these books are cringe, impractical, and peddled by charlatans. Yet, I still huff and puff these motivational lines all the same—just to be productive for only the next few hours.</p>
<p>Have you followed these 4 SECRET tactics to become a productivity god? Wake up at 5am! Take cold showers! Live the 4-hour work week life! Go to the gym to feel better about yourself! What? You didn&rsquo;t? I guess you&rsquo;re not a Sigma life min-maxer 🙃.</p>
<p>The secret to a fulfilling and productive life is not locked within the dome of a wise guru or hidden behind some inspirational quote. Many self-help initiatives don&rsquo;t work because the problem is not the lack of strategy, ideas, or motivation; It&rsquo;s because of the poor <strong>systems of action</strong> we&rsquo;ve cultivated—not building the right habits needed to change our behaviours.</p>
<p>Hence, two self-help books are enough—Triggers and Atomic Habits; the gold that floats above the sea of cringe. Both contain <em>some</em> science into how habits work, and practical advice on the steps we can take to become the person who we want to be. I would also throw in Deep Work by Cal Newport if you&rsquo;re struggling with the ability to focus.</p>
<h2 id="mans-search-for-meaning-by-dr-viktor-frankl">Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning by Dr Viktor Frankl</h2>
<p>When a man is stripped away from everything—his wealth, qualifications, family and dignity…what is left of the man? This book is about the author&rsquo;s experience surviving in a Nazi concentration camp, and his philosophical beliefs that stem from there.</p>
<p>It suggests that we can find the meaning of life through its <strong>pursuit</strong>, which is deeply rooted in human suffering. Each man has his owns circumstances; and his own cross to bear, thus making each suffering unique and personal to the person. There&rsquo;s no YouTube tutorial that teaches you how to become you.</p>
<p>The idea of God reveals itself through <a href="https://utpjournals.press/doi/full/10.3138/uram.36.1-2.65">efforts that overcome said suffering</a>, be it through work (doing something significant), through love, or through courage during difficult times. Therein lies the relation between ethics and Frankl&rsquo;s conception of God—Willpower overcoming fate; “good” overcoming “evil”.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that this book is a very interesting take on Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea of “the man who knows the <strong>why</strong> can bear any <strong>how</strong>.” Even within the cold winter, malnourished and broken, despite knowing that his wife is probably dead—even the angelic “idea” of his wife is enough to keep him alive. The courage and hope to see his wife again is the cross he has to bear.</p>
<p>This is not explicitly a philosophical book; more of an autobiography, in fact. But it is certainly the book that got me interested in the subject.</p>
<hr>
<p>Despite loving for the few books I&rsquo;ve read, I&rsquo;m not exactly a fast reader. I&rsquo;ve only covered 10 last year, and according to my Goodreads peer groups, many of them broke over 20.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently going through Lee Kuan Yew&rsquo;s From Third World to First, as well as Metro 2033. Let me know what are your favourite books so far and why! Would love to hear from you guys.</p>
<p>Cheers 🙃, Jotham</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been introduced to the idea of Copywork by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By-_gbXjEEM">Matthew from TheFutur,</a> and it helped me realise that I&rsquo;ve gone about writing practices all wrong. When training new writers, my original regimen looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing knowledge diets &amp; reading more.</li>
<li>Understand theories behind the written structure.</li>
<li>Write as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s something missing from the picture, and that&rsquo;s <strong>imitation</strong>.</p>
<p>To learn how to play a guitar, you find tabs on the song you like and practice it. To learn how to code, you replicate an online tutorial project. To learn how to cook, you follow recipes to a T.</p>
<p>Yet for writing, you are expected to manifest original and unique ideas from the void. Why is that?</p>
<p>Is it because writing is supposed to be authentic? Is it because imitating other writers is beneath us? Is it because we haven&rsquo;t been taught and are instead punished for copying others from a young age?</p>
<p>Writing is not so special that it transcends regular forms of practice. Copywork is the answer, and here&rsquo;s how you can start:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intentional transcription.</strong> Find an author that you like and copy their text word-for-word. Unlike other mediums, writing reflects the author&rsquo;s mindset and thought process wrapped in style and prose. Re-writing the text helps us reverse engineer that entire process.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection.</strong> Along with the transcriptions, write what you have observed and learnt. Personally, I&rsquo;ve broken it down into two parts: structure, which is the flow of information and how the story is structured; and style, which includes vocabulary usage, sentence length and more.</li>
<li><strong>Imitation.</strong> Using these observations, write a piece on your own while imitating the author as best as you can. This will be your primary form of practice.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust.</strong> Every writer is different and so should the practice regimen. You should adjust the frequency and intention of copyworking to suit your needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is to practice consistently. Even prolific writers like Benjamin Franklin initially had horrible command of the English language. Instead of wallowing in embarrassment, he started by copying magazine authors he looked up to. Now, his writing has contributed to the founding of an entire country.</p>
<hr>
<p>Personally, this article is the result of copyworking Seth Godin&rsquo;s blog. This article may suck and not sound like me, but that&rsquo;s beside the point.</p>
<p>So stay diligent, keep practising, and learn as best as you can.</p>
